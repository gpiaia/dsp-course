abstract = {Video smoke detection has many advantages over traditional methods, such as fast response, non-contact, and so on. But most of video smoke detection systems usually have high false alarms. In order to improve the performance of video smoke detection, we propose an accumulative motion model based on the integral image by fast estimating the motion orientation of smoke. But the estimation is not very precise due to block sum. Not very accurate estimation will affect the subsequent decision. To reduce this influence, the accumulation of the orientation over time is performed to compensate results for the inaccuracy of orientation. The model is able to mostly eliminate the disturbance of artificial lights and non-smoke moving objects by using the accumulation of motion. The model together with chrominance detection can correctly detect the existence of smoke. Experimental results show that our algorithm has good robustness for smoke detection. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper presents an image-processing technique for automatic real-time flame and smoke detection in a tunnel environment. To avoid the large-scale damage caused by fire occurring in different environments, there are many studies about discovering and minimizing an incident as fast as possible. However, we need an original algorithm specialized for a tunnel fire, because this environment is quite different and it is difficult to apply existing fire detection algorithms to a tunnel environment. Therefore, this paper proposes an original algorithm that applies to a tunnel environment. Color and motion information are used to minimize false detections in tunnels, and this information enables us to detect the exact position of an event at an early stage, by detection, test, and verification procedures. The experimental results show the validity and efficiency of the proposed algorithms by a comparison of the characteristics of each algorithm. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Video surveillance systems are widely applied in a variety of fields. Hence, video-based smoke detection is regarded as an effective and inexpensive way for fire detection in an open or large spaces. In order to improve the efficiency of the video-based smoke detection, a novel video-based smoke detection method is proposed by using a histogram sequence of pyramids. The method involves four steps. Firstly, through multi-scale analysis, a 3-level image pyramid is constructed. Secondly, local binary patterns (LBP), which are insensitive to image rotation and illumination conditions, are extracted at each level of the image pyramid with uniform pattern, rotation invariance pattern and rotation invariance uniform pattern to generate an LBP pyramid. Thirdly, local binary patterns based on variance (LBPV) with the same patterns are also adopted in the same way to generate an LBPV pyramid. And fourthly, histograms of the LBP and LBPV pyramids are computed, and then all the histograms are concatenated into an enhanced feature vector. A neural network classifier is trained and used for discrimination of smoke and non-smoke objects. Experimental results show that the features are insensitive to rotation and illumination, and that the method is feasible and effective for video-based smoke detection at interactive frame rates. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

@article{Kim2009,
abstract = {In this paper, we propose a method for smoke detection in outdoor video sequences. We assume that the camera is mounted on a pan/tilt device. The proposed method is composed of three steps. The first step is to decide whether the camera is moving or not. While the camera is moving, we skip the ensuing steps. Otherwise, the second step is to detect the areas of change in the current input frame against the background image and to locate regions of interest(ROIs) by connected component analysis. The block-based approach is applied in both the first and second steps. In the final step, we decide whether the detected ROI is smoke by using the k- temporal information of its color and shape extracted from the ROI. We show the experimental results using in the forest surveillance videos. {\textcopyright} 2008 IEEE.},

abstract = {Real-time video fire flame and smoke detection method based on foreground image accumulation and optical flow technique is presented. Accumulation images are calculated of the foreground images which are extracted using frame differential method. Two parameters are used for the foreground image accumulation to differentiate flame candidate areas from that of smoke. The flame regions are recognized by a statistical model build by foreground accumulation image, while the optical flow is calculated and a motion feature discriminating model to recognize smoke regions is used. The algorithm could realize the real-time fire detection of the following three detection cases: fire with flame and none smoke, fire with smoke and none flame, and fire with both flame and smoke. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Association for Fire Safety Science.},

abstract = {In order to further maintain peace and provide security to people now a day, Closed-circuit television (CCTV) surveillance system is being utilized. This study focused on the design and implementation of a low cost smart security camera with night vision capability using Raspberry Pi (RPI) and OpenCV. The system was designed to be used inside a warehouse facility. It has human detection and smoke detection capability that can provide precaution to potential crimes and potential fire. The credit card size Raspberry Pi (RPI) with Open Source Computer Vision (OpenCV) software handles the image processing, control algorithms for the alarms and sends captured pictures to user's email via Wi-Fi. As part of its alarm system, it will play the recorded sounds: 'intruder' or 'smoke detected' when there is a detection. The system uses ordinary webcam but its IR filter was removed in order to have night vision capability.},

abstract = {In this study, we improve smoke detection approach based on frame movement by analyzing the characteristics of early smoke. Background and different modeling methods are used to detect moving objects in every frame accurately. Sequentially, the image was converted to binary mode, and while undesirable lightness pixels are removed from the image. Smoke was detected by using two features, namely, gray and transparency. The first feature depends on the standard deviation of the object, and the second one measures image transparency. Experimental results show that the suggested algorithm can achieve a high detection rate of smoke approach to 92{\%}. These results were observed by using accuracy scale as a mathematical base for classification.},

@article{Frizzi2016,
abstract = {Research on video analysis for fire detection has become a hot topic in computer vision. However, the conventional algorithms use exclusively rule-based models and features vector to classify whether a frame is fire or not. These features are difficult to define and depend largely on the kind of fire observed. The outcome leads to low detection rate and high false-alarm rate. A different approach for this problem is to use a learning algorithm to extract the useful features instead of using an expert to build them. In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) for identifying fire in videos. Convolutional neural network are shown to perform very well in the area of object classification. This network has the ability to perform feature extraction and classification within the same architecture. Tested on real video sequences, the proposed approach achieves better classification performance as some of relevant conventional video fire detection methods and indicates that using CNN to detect fire in videos is very promising.},

@article{Chen2004a,
abstract = {The paper presents an early fire-alarm raising method based on video processing. The basic idea of the proposed of fire-detection is to adopt a RGB (red, green, blue) model based chromatic and disorder measurement for extracting fire-pixels and smoke-pixels. The decision function of fire-pixels is mainly deduced by the intensity and saturation of R component. The extracted fire-pixels will be verified if it is a real fire by both dynamics of growth and disorder, and furtherly smoke. Based on iterative checking on the growing ratio of flames, a fire-alarm is given when the alarm-raising condition is met. Experimental results show that the developed technique can achieve fully automatic surveillance of fire accident with a lower false alarm rate and thus is very attractive for the important military, social security, commercial applications, and so on, at a general cost. {\textcopyright} 2004 IEEE.},
